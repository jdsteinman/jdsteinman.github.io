I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://www.caam.rice.edu) (CMOR) at Rice University in Houston, TX. My PhD research is advised by Prof. [Matthias Heinkenschloss](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/) and focuses on the analysis and implementation of collocation methods for differential equations and optimal control. Previously, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Willerson Center for Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation](https://wccms.oden.utexas.edu) under the direction of Prof. [Michael S. Sacks](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Michael-S.-Sacks/) and Dr. [Alex Khang](https://www.colorado.edu/ansethgroup/alex-khang). My undergraduate research focused on inverse modeling of hydrogel media used to study heart valve cells.
